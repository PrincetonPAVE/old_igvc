Change Log
----------

1.7 Release Candidate 13 (January 15 2008)
- Fixed issue with the non-colour processing algorithm for raw8 images.  New processing now uses less CPU resources.
- Created a flycapture_FULL installation which include the processor optimized IPP dll's.  This will give best results and is the recommended installation.  For customers who require a smaller installation file, flycapture.exe is still available but with non-optimized IPP dlls.
- Created a seperate installer for 64-installations.  This fixes issues with dlls going into the SYSWOW64 directory on 64-bnit systems instead of the system 32 directory.  This also fixes issues with the 64-bit registry settings.
- Added utility (C1EDisable) which writes a registery setting which flycapture checks when running.  Enhanced Halt State (C1E) will be disabled while flycapture is running if this setting is set.  C1E will be re-enabled when flycapture exits.  Included this option as part of the installation dialogs as well.
- Added support for new cameras in flycapture.dll to report proper sensor descriptions and resolutions.

1.7 Alpha 11 and Beta 12
- Internal Build

1.7 Alpha 10 (November 26 2007)

   and cause the displayed ROI to move accordingly.
 - Combined the Color Processing tab with the White Balance tab.  Renamed the
   tab to White Balance/Color.  White Balance will now detect if the current
   camera uses hardware or software white balance and hide the inappropriate set
   of sliders.
 - Major revamp of the Camera Control dialog layout.  The tabs at the top of
   the dialog have been removed and replaced by a tree control on the left

   The image size, cursor location, and 8-bit RGB value of the current pixel
   are now displayed in the status bar if the FlyCap window is active. 
   Controlled through the status bar or the View menu as well.
 - Fixed bug 3250 - Save .bmp file with the proper size embedded in the header.

 - You must recompile your code to use this new release.
 - Fixed bug 2163 - Various threadsafe issues with respect to resizing 
   an internal buffer while doing colour processing from it.
 - flycaptureGetCustomImageMaxPacketSize() has become 
   flycaptureGetCustomImagePacketInfo(), please start using this function and
   recompile your code.
 - Implemented bug 2350 - Now checking system memory before allocating user
   supplied number of buffers.
 - More bug 2087 fixes.  FlyCaptureImageEvent has changed.
 - Major changes to flycaptureSaveImage() and flycaptureConvertImage().  These
   functions now both take a FlyCaptureImage.  Please see API documentation.

   appropriate video mode and frame rate if invalid parameters are passed in
   use FLYCAPTURE_VIDEOMODE_ANY and FLYCAPTURE_FRAMERATE_ANY to start the 
   camera in its current mode and framerate.
 - Fixed bug 2556 - We were responding to some USB 2.0 bus notification
   messages.

   DriverControlGUI is an experimental program to provide driver selection
   functionality.
 - A note on 1394b and Windows XP Service Pack 2:  If you are a Dragonfly
   Express user and are running Windows XP Service Pack 2, you must run the
   fixSP2g.exe program in the 'bin' directory of the FlyCapture installation.
   1394b support was removed by Microsoft for Service Pack 2, and the 
   fixSP2g.exe program automatically downgrades the Windows 1394 drivers to 
   their SP1 state.  This is a temporary kludge until Microsoft comes out with 
   a hotfix to correct this problem.  This is PGR internal bug 2550 and bug
   2442.


1.5 Alpha 11 (7 September 2004)

 - Implemented bug 1842.  We now report the low-level bus number and node 
   number of devices in the FlyCaptureInfoEx structure.  This is only useful
   if you have multiple 1394 cards in your machine.  New API function:
   flycaptureBusEnumerateCamerasEx().

   control dialog.
 - Fixed bug 2412 - We now properly handle 1394b modes, including S800.  Please
   note that S800 is currently broken in Windows XP Service Pack 2.  We do not 
   recommend installing SP2.  This is PGR Bug 2442.


1.5 Alpha 10 (22 June 2004)

   flycaptureLockNext() as well as the lock latest and grab calls.
 - Implemented bug 1423, bug 2087 - Partial image notification functionality.
   New structures: FlyCaptureImageEvent New functions: 
    - flycaptureInitializeNotify()
	- flycaptureLockNextEvent()
	- flycaptureWaitForImageEvent()
	- flycaptureUnlockEvent()
   Please see API documentation in flycaptureplus.h and the new example, 
   ImageEventEx.  Please note that to use this functionality, you need a
   hotfix from Microsoft. (It might be included in XP SP2, however.)  Please
   context PGR for information on how to aquire this fix to the 1394 subsystem.


1.5 Alpha 07 (5 May 2004)

 - Fixed bug 1134 - We now respond to and pass FLYCAPTURE_MESSAGE_BUS_RESET
   messages for all 1394 bus resets.
 - Added a secondary frame rate to the FlyCap display.  The new frame rate (the
   middle value in the status bar) indicates the display rate of the images.
   The first frame rate, which also appears in the title bar of the app is the
   camera grab rate.
 - Implemented bug 1902 - Added FLYCAPTURE_DEPRECATED error code for deprecated
   functions.
 - Implemented bug 2095 - Implemented flycaptureSetGrabTimeoutEx().
   flycaptureSetGrabTimeout() is now deprecated and will stop functioning soon.
 - Fixed bug 2119 - Handle leak on start()/stop()/start().


1.5 Alpha 06 (21 April 2004)

 - A PixelFormat argument has been added to 
   flycaptureStartLockNextCustomImage().  This must be provided.  Use 
   flycaptureQueryCustomImage() to find out what pixel formats the camera 
   supports.  Please see the CustomImageEx example for more information.
 - Added .avi saving functionality to FlyCap.  To save an .avi clip, start the
   camera with the red play button for recording mode.  Fill out the dialog,
   then hit F9 or use the menu item to save an .avi clip.  Hit F9 again to save
   another clip.  (it will clobber the file.)  To save a clip when in custom 
   image mode, do the following:  Star the camera the normal way (green play
   buttom), go into custom image mode using the dialog.  Stop the camera by
   unclicking the green play button.  Click the red record play button.  You
   are now in record mode with a custom image size.  This non-intuitiveness
   is documented in PGR bug 2002 and will be corrected soon.
 - .avi clip saving in FlyCap ignores the legacy 2GB limit on .avi files.  To
   split avi files so that they can be played with legacy video players, we
   recommend VirtualDub, http://virtualdub.org.  This is PGR bug 2001.
 - Fixed bug 2009 - Removed sometimes-annoying error dialog boxes.
 - Fixed bug 1893 - Better error reporting in SaveToAviEx when it can't write
   to the destination path.
 - The distributed version of timeSliceDemo now supports saving to .avi.
