===============================================================================
Triclops SDK 3.2

Triclops 3.2 Beta 14 (October 25 2007)
 - Fixed issues related to the saved image formats (bug 5167).  Stereo inputs 
   can now be saved as a side-by-side .pgm.  Side-by-side colour .ppm images may 
   be loaded as stereo inputs but only the green channel will be used for 
   processing (.pgm files are recommended).
 - Fixed a bug where changing the stereo processing size would corrupt loaded
   data.
 - The baseline is now selectable when using a multi-baseline calibration file
   (eg. XB3) and saved data.  Please make sure the processing baseline is 
   consistent with the baseline the data was saved from.
 - Fixed a minor issue where invalid file extensions would be displayed in some
   dialogs.

Triclops 3.2 Beta 13 (July 10 2007)
 - Added and modified sln and vcproj files so that all examples build with VS2005.

Triclops 3.2 Beta 12 (June 4 2007)
 - Fixed minor bug related to starting hi-res Bumblebee2s in TriclopsDemo.

Triclops 3.2 Beta 11 (June 1 2007)

 - Added support for low-res Bumblebee2s.
 - Fixed various bugs in examples.

Triclops 3.2 Beta 10 (April 2 2007)

 - Added triclopsDemo example which is used for stereo using Bumblebee2's and XB3's.
 - Most triclops examples have been converted to use the Flycapture API and moved
   to the win32 examples folder.
 - We should no longer be using the Digiclops API.

Triclops 3.2 Beta 9 (February 5 2007)

 - Bug 4883 - Adding missing calibration and stereo input files into the bin 
   directory for use by the stereospeed example. 

Triclops 3.2 Beta 8

 - Fixed a bug (2200) that causes 3 Camera stereo to sometimes give a poor result 
   under subpixel interpolation.  This has reduced the speed of 3Cam stereo but
   also improved the depth quality
 - Fixed a bug (2028) with triclopsWriteDefaultContextToFile() - function now works
   correctly
 - Major reorganization and changes to the Triclops example programs
	All previous examples have been replaced/modified and new examples added
	to better demonstrate Triclops library functionality

Triclops 3.2 Beta 7

 - This release is identical to Triclops 3.2 Alpha 6.


Triclops 3.2 Alpha 6  

 - Major reorganization of the "triclops.h" file
      The file now only has the essential functions declared in it and instead
      includes a variety of specialized .h files such as "triclops3d.h",
      "triclopsstereo.h", "triclopsrectify.h", etc
 - triclopsPreprocess() has been replaced by triclopsRectify() and marked for
   deprecation
 - Widebaseline functionality has been marked for deprecation : 
   triclopsCreateWidebaselineContext() and triclopsCreateWidebaselineInput()
 - Skewing correction
      In order to enforce vertical and horizontal epipoline alignement, some
   degree of skewing may be present in the rectified image.  New version (4.0 or
   later) of the calibration file will include a skewing and an unskewing matrices
   to correct for this artifact. Earlier version calibration files will default
   these correction matrices to an identify matrix indicating no correction to be
   performed. 
   The usage of these correction matrices are automatically done in triclopsRCDToXYZ
   and triclopsXYZToRCD, so there is no need for user level code change to benefit 
   from the skewing correction.
 - Removed the deprecated 'ok' error code.  Please use TriclopsErrorOk.


Triclops 3.2 Alpha 5

 - Dramatic speedup in Enhanced rectification modes. 
     Example 1:  On a 2.4 GHz PIV processor with 1GB RAM, with a lo-res B&W 
		 bumblebee at 640x480 resolution, rectification using mode
		 TriRectQlty_ENHANCED_2 requires 76 ms (about 13 Hz).
     Example 2:  On a 2.4 GHz PIV processor with 1GB RAM, with a hi-res color 
		 bumblebee at 1024x768 resolution, rectification using mode
		 TriRectQlty_ENHANCED_2 requires 203 ms (about 5 Hz).

 - Fixed bug in Enhanced Rectification modes (mostly affecting mode
	TriRectQlty_ENHANCED_1).

 - Added new Triclops API call triclopsWriteCurrentContextToFile(). This allows 
	the user to save the current configuration to a file, which can then be
	read in at a later time to reset all stereo parameters to the values 
	which existed at the time the file was written.

Triclops 3.2 Alpha 4

 - Sped up 2-cam subpixel stereo by about 20% for processors supporting SSE2.
 - Sped up 2-cam full-pixel stereo by about 10% for processors supporting SSE2.
 - Sped up 3-cam stereo by about 10% for processors supporting SSE2.
 - Fixed bug 1846


Triclops 3.2 Alpha 3

 - Fixed bug 1809, 1828


Triclops 3.2 Alpha 1

 - Added two stereo enhancements, one for rectification and one for basic stereo
   algorithm. Both provide more accurate data at the subpixel level, and should
   reduce artifacts in the disparity/depth data. API to Triclops library has 
   been augmented. See triclopsSetRectImgQuality() and triclopsSetStereoQuality().
 - Increased allowable maximum disparity value from 240 to 1024. (Disparity
   range is still limited to 240.) Disparity offset is now part of the library. 
   See triclopsGetDisparityOffset().
 - New calls to read/write processed images from the triclops context to/from
   PGM files. Useful information is now stored in the PGM header, and accessible
   when the image is read back in. See e.g. triclopsSaveImageExtra().
 - Fixed bug 1287 - all versions of stereo now handle the borders of the disparity
   range in the same way.
 - Fixed bug 1751 - to do with bogus results when using the disparity mapping 
   option (non-subpixel stereo only).
 - Other minor bug fixes.

===============================================================================
Triclops SDK 2.5

Feature Enhancements
    + triclopsDemo program has been removed.  It is replaced by a much 
      improved digiclopsDemo that is shipped with the Digiclops distribution
    + improvements to color rectification functions
      triclopsRectifyColorImage() and triclopsRectifyPackedColorImage() have
      been changed to accept a TriclopsCamera identifier.  This lets Color
      Digiclops users rectify any of the three color images.
    + multi-thread capability added
      The Triclops library has been modified so that multiple TriclopsContexts
      can exist in the same thread space.  The modifications should also allow
      a single TriclopsContext to be used in multiple threads.  However!  This
      functionality has not been rigorously tested.
